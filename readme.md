A Kanban board is a method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively. This application will provide users with a digital Kanban board, where they can manage several lists of tasks for each board.

In this application I created this with another developer in a partner programming enviroment. We created this application with Vue2 clientside as well as a Node server. Listed below are some of the features in this application.

- The user can create an account with auth0
- Once the user is logged in they can create a board with a title and description.
- By selecting the Board the user will be navigated to that board page.
- The user can create/edit/delete lists once in the board details page.
- The user can select the drop down on the bottom let to create/edit/delete tasks as well as move the tasks to a diffrent list.
- The user can mark the tasks as completed
- the user can create/edit/delete comments inside the tasks
